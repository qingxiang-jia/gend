**Gend**

It's a backend written for my music-player project, which is going to be a PWA. But filesystem interaction for PWA (at least now, at least on Chrome) is pretty awkward, so for development purpose, I want a static file server, and this is it.

In the future, if the PWA filesystem API is still so bad, I will consider converting this into a tiny backend that the user of the music player can just download and run together with the PWA (then what's the point of PWA?ðŸ˜‚).
